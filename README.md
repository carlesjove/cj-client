# cj-client
fully-compliant Collection+JSON client 

NOTES:
 - uses no external libs/frameworks
 - built/tested for chrome browser (YMMV on other browsers)
 - designed to act as a "validator" for a human-driven Cj client.
 - not production robust (missing error-handling, perf-tweaking, etc.)
 - report issues to https://github.com/collection-json/cj-client
